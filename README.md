# Duckie - Duckworth-Lewis
Duckie is a Duckworth-Lewis calculator for target scores in weather affected cricket matches.

It allows you to enter details for a limited overs cricket match and calculates a target score using the Standard Edition of the Duckworth-Lewis method.

You can enter the total number of overs available at the beginning of each innings to account for reduced overs before the match begins, as well as reduced overs between innings.

It also allows you to add interruptions which occur during an innings, which can be edited or deleted afterwards.

There is the ability to change the match type between One Day and Twenty20 and also set a custom G50 value to be used in the calculation.
