# Duckie (Android app)
Duckie is a Duckworth-Lewis calculator which calculates target scores in weather affected cricket matches. It allows you to enter details for a limited overs cricket match and calculates a target score using the Standard Edition of the Duckworth-Lewis method. You can enter the total number of overs available at the beginning of each innings to account for reduced overs before the match begins, as well as between innings. It also allows you to add interruptions which occur during an innings, which can be edited or deleted afterward.

Duckie uses the Standard Edition which was used for all matches prior to 2003. The current method used for all international matches is the Professional Edition, however using this method requires software which is not publicly available. The results using the Standard Edition are generally similar to those from the Professional Edition, but the results start to diverge for very high first innings totals (around 350 runs and more).
