# Duckie (Android app)
Duckie is a cricket calculator featuring a Duckworth-Lewis calculator and an overs lost calculator. More calculators are coming in future versions!

The Duckworth-Lewis calculator calculates target scores in weather affected cricket matches. It allows you to enter details for a limited overs cricket match and calculates a target score using the Standard Edition of the Duckworth-Lewis method. You can enter the total number of overs available at the beginning of each innings to account for reduced overs before the match begins, as well as between innings. It also allows you to add interruptions which occur during an innings, which can be edited or deleted afterward.

The overs lost calculator allows you to enter the amount of playing time lost due to bad weather, and that calculates the total number of overs that are lost due to the interruption. The calculations are based on over rates provided in the ICC Playing Handbook, but can also been changed to a custom over rate per hour.

More features are planned for future versions, so please leave any feedback on improvements or features you would like to be seen added.
