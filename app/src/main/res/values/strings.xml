    <string name="about_page_first_paragraph">This app calculates target scores in weather affected
        cricket matches using the Duckworth-Lewis method. It uses the Standard Edition which was
        used for all matches prior to 2003. The current method used for all international matches
        is the Professional Edition, however using this method requires software which is not publicly
        available. The results using the Standard Edition are generally similar to those from the
        Professional Edition, but the results start to diverge for very high first innings totals
        (around 350 runs and more).</string>
    <string name="about_page_second_paragraph">Results are calculated using the over-by-over tables
        provided in the ICC Playing Handbook 2013-2014. The G50 figure used in the calculation is
        245, which is the default for matches involving ICC full member nations and teams playing
        first class cricket. The ability to change G50 to a custom number is planned for a future
        version of the app. This app is intended to be used for 50 over matches, but support for
        Twenty20 matches is also planned for a future version.</string>
